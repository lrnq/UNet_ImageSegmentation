# Implementation of UNet for Image Segmentation
The notebook contains a full walk through of loading, exploring (briefly) and preparing images from the retina dataset for image segmentation. There is an implementation of UNet along with sligthly altered versions of the classic architecture. This implementation contains custom loss functions and metrics and various bits of codes for predicting on unseen data and evaluating results.
